<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a> offers several developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building projects, and this repository contains my solution to all of those web app projects.

Each of these projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help users build up project incrementally and ensure fulfillment of all the user stories before submission.
